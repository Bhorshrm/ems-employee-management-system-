Assignment: Employee Management System
Develop a web-based Employee Management System that
allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)
employee records. The system should provide an intuitive
user interface for interacting with employee data and should
leverage the Spring MVC framework for the backend, JSP for
templating, JavaScript/jQuery for client-side logic, and
Syncfusion components for enhanced UI elements.

Requirements:

Backend:
• Use Spring MVC to create RESTful APIs for
handling CRUD operations on employee data.
• Implement a database layer with Spring Data JPA
or Hibernate for ORM. Use an in-memory database
like H2 for simplicity.
• Include basic authentication to protect the
application. Use Spring Security to manage login
functionality.

Frontend:
• Use JSP for server-side rendering of the frontend.
Employ JSTL (JavaServer Pages Standard Tag
Library) to effectively display data on the frontend.
• Utilize JavaScript/jQuery to make asynchronous
API calls to the backend for CRUD operations
without needing to refresh the page.
• Integrate Syncfusion components for UI elements
like Data Grids, Forms, and Buttons. Specifically,
use the Syncfusion DataGrid component to display
employee records in a tabular format with features
like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
Employee Data Model:
• Each employee record should have the following
fields: ID, Name, Email, Department, and Status
(Active/Inactive).
Features:
• List View: Display all employees in a Syncfusion
DataGrid with options to sort and filter.

• Create: A form to add a new employee record.
• Update: Option to edit existing employee details.
• Delete: Option to remove an employee record.
• Search: Implement a search feature to find
employees by name or department.
• Authentication: Secure the application and restrict
access to authenticated users only.

Deliverables:


Source Code: Provide a GitHub repository link containing the
complete source code.
• Documentation: Include a README file with:
• Setup instructions.
• A brief overview of the application architecture.
• Any assumptions made during development.
Demo: (Optional) Host a live demo of the application on
platforms like Heroku or provide a video demo
showcasing its functionality.


Evaluation Criteria:
• Code Quality: Clean, modular, and well-documented
code.
• Functionality: All features should work as described.
• Design: Use of Syncfusion components to create an
intuitive and responsive user interface.
• Understanding of Technologies: Effective use of Spring
MVC, JSP, JavaScript/jQuery, and Syncfusion.
• Creativity: Any additional features or enhancements that
improve user experience or application performance.

This assignment is designed to be comprehensive, covering
various aspects of full-stack development, and should
provide a good basis for evaluating a candidate's skills across
the required technologies. Ensure to provide candidates with
enough time to complete the assignment, considering its
complexity and the need for a detailed approach.
